# pickme

It is a CLI menu driven ride sharing application done as part of CMPE 202 course of my MSSE.

The ride sharing app uses some 10+ GoF design patterns and supports operations to book a ride, pay for a ride, schedule the ride and has 2 simple routing strategies based on fastest time or shortest path (Dijkastra's algorithm for undirected graph). The main design patterns used are: bridge, strategy, state, composite, builder, singleton, template method, etc.
